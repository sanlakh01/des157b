        <h2>Davis Redo</h2>
        <p>Welcome, wanderer and seeker of knowledge!<br><br>During this portion of your travels, you walk through sparse paths, guided by a hawk. The hawk not only lights your way, but also brings you challenges to solve. These challenges gift you with the knowledge of the town you once came from and are now trying to return to. <br><br>Information:<br><br>Davis Rewind is an online escape room themed around the seal of the town of Davis, California. There are a total of 12 puzzles, after each of which you get rewarded with a slice of the seal as well as some knowledge about the town. </p>
