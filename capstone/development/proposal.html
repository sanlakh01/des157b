            <h2>Topic and Target Audience</h2>
            <p>For the capstone project, we want to develop a scavenger hunt centered around different sections of the seal. We want to aim at Davis elementary, middle, and high schools, although we may modify the target audience to better match curriculum goals.</p>

            <h2>Potential Features</h2>
            <p>The scavenger hunt will be riddle based - for each slice of the seal, there will a riddle to solve. To solve the riddle, the user will have to mark the corresponding point on a map of Davis. Once they correctly mark a section, they earn a slice of the seal, until they are able to form a full seal. </p>
            <p>Since the target audience covers a large age group, there will be at least 2 versions of the riddle - one easier and one harder. If time permits, we may also have hints for the riddle.</p>

            <h2>Concerns</h2>
            <p>It will be interesting to work with someone else, as I've never worked with someone on a collaborative web project. Also, I wonder how we will execute our ideas and how within the scope of this class is our idea. Mostly, I'm excited to see what Brenda and I can achieve together.</p>
