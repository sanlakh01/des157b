            <h2>User Testing with Andre, Xinyi, and Brain</h2>
            <p>All of our user testers loved our concept and design. As they worked their way through our puzzles, they all struggled at the same portions and breezed their way through the same portions. They enjoyed the narration around the journey, and enjoyed the context that it provided.</p>
            <p>Some changes that were recommended is to make the visual hierarchy more clear, and reduce the width of the instruction panel so that it is easier to read. We also got recommended an about-us page, so that players will have further context about the images we chose, our sources, and storytelling.</p>

            <h2>Community Partner Feedback</h2>
            <p>Sharing our project with Susan and Rachel was really rewarding. They both enjoyed our concept and appreciated the amount of research that has gone into this project. Rachel recommended that we add a link to the Davis City website at the end of the escape room and Susan is going to send us a phrase that is written in the Patwin language which we are going to implement into our project. We are extremely happy with our progress so far and look forward to the final version.</p>
