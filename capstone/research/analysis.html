            <p>The above <a href="https://mrnussbaum.com//uploads/activities/landmarks2/little-big-horn.htm">website</a> discuses different landmarks across the United States. People can click on different points and it provides information about said landmark. Audience-wise, this website seems to be aimed at high school students - I think this will help us in writing age-appropriate content. While the design, user experience, and interface are extremely simple and to the point, the content and the concept is helpful.</p>

            <p>The above <a href="https://www.nps.gov/features/azru/">website</a> is from the National Park Service, and has activities on a map aimed at younger children. This is also an age group we want to target, and like the other website, is helpful when it comes to text. It is also helps us in simplifying content to be age-appropriate. However, like the above website, the design is simple and isn't something we would incorporate.</p>
